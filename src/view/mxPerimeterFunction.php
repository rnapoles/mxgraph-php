     * Defines the requirements for a perimeter function.
     *
     * Function: apply
     *
     * Implements a perimeter function.
     *
     * Parameters:
     *
     * bounds - <mxRectangle> that represents the absolute bounds of the
     * vertex.
     * vertex - <mxCellState> that represents the vertex.
     * next - <mxPoint> that represents the nearest neighbour point on the
     * given edge.
     * orthogonal - Boolean that specifies if the orthogonal projection onto
     * the perimeter should be returned. If this is false then the intersection
     * of the perimeter and the line between the next and the center point is
     * returned.
